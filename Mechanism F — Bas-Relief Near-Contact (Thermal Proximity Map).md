Mechanism F — Bas-Relief Near-Contact (Thermal Proximity Map)

F.1 Purpose & Position in the Model

Mechanism F tests whether a low-relief form under a damp linen can yield a soft, superficial tonal map via radiant/convective proximity—without true pressing or pigment. It’s a bridge between pure projection (E) and free-field damp heating (A), designed to show:

no “touch lines” (hard contact edges),

graded tone tracking air-gap thickness, and

superficial, non-pigment coloration when operated below char thresholds.


F.2 Physical Rationale

Air-gap diffusion: A 0.5–3.0 mm gap behaves like a micro-insulating layer; heat transfer decays with distance → continuous gradients, not contact ridges.

Damp buffer: 8–15 % moisture raises char threshold and confines oxidation to fibril skins.

Edge fall-off: Relief slopes produce gentle luminance roll-off (∂T/∂x small), matching the Shroud’s “photographic” softness.


F.3 Apparatus

Bas-relief token: smooth, shallow profile (e.g., plaster face/bust fragment or sculpted clay tile), max step height 1–3 mm, no sharp edges.

Spacers: single linen threads/horsehair to prevent true contact (0.3–0.6 mm).

Linen F: 25×25 cm, pre-washed; damp 10 % by mass.

Heat source: halogen + concave mirror (as A/E), tuned for 130–165 °C at cloth.

Mount: relief face-up on fire-safe tray; cloth draped loosely above with uniform spacer grid (25–40 mm pitch).

Sensors: IR thermometer; optional thermocouple at relief apex.


F.4 Protocol (Step-by-Step)

1. Set gap: place 4 corner spacers (thread bundles ≈0.5 mm). Lay cloth so it floats above relief; add light frame weights ≥5 cm off edges to avoid sagging.


2. Moisture check: re-mist to restore 10 % if needed (cool to touch, non-glossy).


3. Flux tune: position mirror+lamp 0.8–1.2 m; verify 130–165 °C at cloth over relief apex.


4. Expose: 6–14 min, monitoring that no point exceeds 180 °C. Do not press the cloth.


5. Cool: 5 min ambient; dry 1 h; quarantine 24 h before diagnostics.



> Variants:
F-A (pure) damp only; F-C (hybrid) thin starch 1 % + urea 0.5 % film (Maillard-assist) for lower temp/shorter time.



F.5 Expected Image Physics & Signatures

Feature	Prediction	Why it matters

Gradient, no ridge	Smooth tone from apex outward; no hard outline	Discriminates from pressure rubbings
Superficiality	≤ 40 µm proxy	Matches Shroud’s fibril-skin colour
No reverse	No back-print	Non-penetrative heating
Tape-lift	Clear from image; particulate from stains only	Non-pigment oxidation
UV	Mild under-fluorescence	Consistent with oxidised cellulose
3-D encodability	Intensity ~ inverse gap	Luminance→height correlation (weak-to-moderate)


F.6 Diagnostics & Data Capture

Macro maps: zenith and raking-light photos; annotate apex lines.

Edge micrographs: razor side-sections at apex & mid-slope → confirm shallow colour band.

Gap profiling: feeler gauges or photo-triangulation to log actual cloth-to-relief distances at 5–10 landmarks; regress gray vs gap.

Tape-lift/UV: as per A/C; expect clean tape at image zones; under-fluorescence.

Intensity profiles: radial lines from apex; export CSV; compute gradient smoothness (2nd derivative).


F.7 Quantitative Benchmarks

Metric	Target / Pass band

Max surface T	130–165 °C (never > 180 °C)
Moisture	8–15 %
Depth	≤ 40 µm (proxy)
ΔL* (apex)	5–9 vs background
Ridge index (edge hardness)	< 0.15 (normalised peak-to-slope ratio)
Gray–gap R²	≥ 0.55 (F-A) / ≥ 0.65 (F-C)


F.8 Failure Modes & Fixes

Symptom	Likely cause	Remedy

Hard outline/ridge	Cloth touched relief	Increase spacer height; add perimeter standoffs
Deep brown core	Over-temp or dry patch	Re-mist; increase distance; shorten exposure
Patchy islands	Uneven gap or flux	Level the relief; rotate sample halfway
Soot specks	Contaminated source	Clean reflector; reduce flame soot


F.9 Comparison vs Other Mechanisms

Property	A (Damp Free-Field)	C (Maillard)	F (Near-Contact)	E (Projection)

Geometry driver	Global flux	Global flux + chemistry	Gap-mediated flux	Optical image
Edge character	Soft	Softer	Soft, apex-centred	Soft, optical blur
3-D encodability	Moderate	Moderate	High local (gap law)	High global (radiometry)
Contact artefacts	None	None	None if spaced	None


F.10 Interpretation

A successful F-series run that avoids contact lines, keeps image superficial, and shows intensity tracking the air-gap proves a non-contact, physical route to relief mapping under Renaissance constraints. It complements E (optics) by showing how local geometry alone (without a full projection setup) can encode soft anatomical reliefs.

F.11 Safety Notes

Work on metal/ceramic base; maintain ventilation; keep spray bottle/extinguisher within reach; monitor temps continuously; never leave halogen + mirror unattended.
