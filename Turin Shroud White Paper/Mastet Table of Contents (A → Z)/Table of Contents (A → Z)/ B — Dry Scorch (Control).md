Mechanism B — Dry Scorch (Control / Falsification Protocol)

B.1 Purpose and Function

Mechanism B is the negative control: a completely dry scorch intended to demonstrate what happens when moisture buffering is absent.
Without damp moderation, cellulose absorbs radiant energy rapidly, causing deep pyrolysis and thermal penetration far beyond the Shroud’s observed superficiality.
This test establishes the boundary between chemical oxidation (yellowing) and thermal carbonisation (brown/black charring).

B.2 Physical Rationale

Process	Parameter	Effect

Dry heating	0 % H₂O	Direct conduction into fibre bundles.
Flux density	≥ 2 kW m⁻²	Rapid temperature rise (> 200 °C).
No Leidenfrost barrier	—	No evaporative cooling; full thermal penetration.
Pyrolysis threshold	~ 210–230 °C	Lignin/cellulose decomposition, caramelisation of impurities.


The outcome is expected to be a deep, fibrous scorch, visible on the reverse side, showing that dryness removes the key variable controlling depth and tone.

B.3 Apparatus & Setup

Linen B: 100 % flax, air-dried for > 48 h, moisture < 2 %.

Mount: identical frame and reflective mirror as A to ensure identical geometry.

Heat source: halogen lamp (400–500 W) or micro-torch, flux adjusted for 150–250 °C surface.

Monitoring: IR thermometer with continuous readout.

Safety: Fire-retardant base, fume extraction.


B.4 Procedure

Step	Action	Target

1	Weigh sample to confirm dryness (< 2 %).	Baseline control.
2	Position lamp at 0.6 m (150–250 °C).	Direct flux.
3	Expose 1–5 min; observe progressive browning.	Terminate > 230 °C.
4	Cool 5 min; photograph both sides.	Document penetration.
5	Repeat × 3 for reproducibility.	B1–B3 dataset.


B.5 Expected Outcomes

Property	Observation	Verification

Tone	Dark brown to black	Colour L* drop > 20.
Depth	Penetration full fibre (> 200 µm)	Cross-section microscopy.
Binder residue	None	Tape-lift → visible char dust.
Fluorescence	Quenched (dark)	Strong carbon absorption.
Reverse image	Present	Burn-through confirmed.


B.6 Diagnostic Criteria (Fail Conditions)

Image visible on reverse (FAIL superficiality).

Tape-lift carries char fragments (FAIL non-pigment).

Under UV, fluoresces dark (FAIL optical neutrality).

Smells of burnt cellulose (FAIL chemical control).

Stain mask ineffective (FAIL selectivity).


If any of these appear, the test correctly falsifies the dry-scorch route.

B.7 Comparative Metrics (vs A)

Metric	Mechanism A	Mechanism B	Δ / Comment

Mean depth (µm)	≤ 40	> 200	Fails superficiality
ΔL (lightness)	5–8	> 20	Over-darkened
UV ratio	0.85	0.45	Strong absorption
Tape-lift clarity	> 95 % transparent	Char visible	Pigment presence
Reverse mark	None	Yes	Heat conduction


B.8 Interpretation

Mechanism B serves as the control falsification: it shows that direct dry scorching inevitably breaches every Shroud criterion.
The charred, fibrous penetration confirms that moisture buffering—not mere heat—is the essential factor for shallow oxidation.
This comparison validates Mechanism A as the only pathway reproducing the correct physical limits.

B.9 Analytical Significance

The B-series provides the calibration floor for the Digital Twin:

Depths > 150 µm mark the transition to pyrolysis.

Flux > 2 kW m⁻² breaks superficiality.

Optical density ratios beyond 2.0 indicate soot formation.
All subsequent models (C through E) must fall below this regime to qualify as plausible Shroud analogues.


B.10 Conclusion

Mechanism B demonstrates that dry heat alone cannot reproduce the Turin image.
It produces excessive penetration, pigment deposition, and total loss of tonal gradation—failing the scientific test of similarity.
Therefore, the Damp-Layer Photothermal model (A) remains uniquely capable of generating the Shroud’s superficial, non-pigment image within Renaissance technological constraints.
