Mechanism G — Global Integration & Validation System

G.1 Purpose

Mechanism G is the culminating verification protocol—to replicate a life-size Shroud-class image by integrating the most successful parameters from A (Damp-Layer Photothermal), C (Maillard-Assist), E (Radiant Projection), and F (Bas-Relief Proximity) into a single unified optical-thermal system.
Its goals:

1. Demonstrate full-scale uniformity of tone and superficiality.


2. Prove reproducibility with Renaissance-credible resources.


3. Generate complete quantitative data (geometry, flux, depth, chemistry).

G.2 Core Architecture

Subsystem	Function	Derived From

Optical projection core	Produces image geometry and negative polarity	E
Thermal-moisture chamber	Maintains 8–12 % moisture; flux 120–165 °C	A
Chemical priming layer	Starch–urea 1 % / 0.5 % film for uniform sensitivity	C
Bas-relief stabiliser	Controls proximity curvature for depth encoding	F
Control nodes	Dry-scorch & soot falsifiers for boundary mapping	B / D


Each subsystem contributes one axis: light × heat × chemistry × geometry = image.

G.3 Chamber Configuration

Scale: 2.5 m × 1.2 m × 1.2 m (half-length prototype).

Walls: matte black fibreboard; single 4 cm aperture with bronze mirror (R ≈ 1.2 m).

Heat sources: dual 500 W halogen lamps in parabolic reflectors; secondary oil-lamp array for visible spectrum simulation.

Atmosphere: humidity 55 % ± 5 %; internal temperature 24 °C baseline.

Sensors: 4 × IR thermometers, 2 × thermocouples, 1 × hygrometer.

Safety: fire blanket, CO₂ extinguisher, auto cut-off at > 190 °C.

G.4 Procedure Overview

1. Prime cloth: brush starch–urea solution evenly; dry 12 h.


2. Mount cloth vertically on wooden frame 3 m from mirror focus.


3. Insert form/model: low-relief cast positioned opposite aperture (light source side).


4. Set damp condition: mist until 10 % moisture by mass.


5. Align mirror: project optical image onto cloth at focal distance; check flux 1.1–1.6 kW m⁻².


6. Expose: 10 min (three 3 min pulses with 1 min intervals).


7. Rotate cloth 180° for dorsal phase (optional).


8. Cool: 30 min; record weight loss; store 24 h before analysis.

G.5 Data Acquisition Matrix

Sensor	Variable	Rate	Purpose

IR-1	Surface T (°C)	1 Hz	Flux control
IR-2	Relief apex T	1 Hz	Gradient mapping
Hygrometer	RH (%)	1 min	Moisture stability
Thermocouple	Air temp (°C)	1 Hz	Chamber uniformity
Camera	RGB frame	30 s	Real-time image development


Digital Twin Model (Ver. 2.1) ingests these streams to predict oxidation dose D(x,y,t) and compare with live colour maps.

G.6 Acceptance Criteria

1. Superficial image layer: ≤ 40 µm average depth (macro proxy).


2. Non-pigment coloration: tape-lift clear; EDS = no exogenous particles.


3. Negative polarity: brightness inversion verified by digital invert.


4. Stain–image order reproducible.


5. 3-D correlatability: gray ↔ height R² ≥ 0.7.


6. Replicable in three runs (G1–G3) within ± 10 % tone uniformity.

G.7 Predicted Results

Colour tone: L* drop 6–8; visually straw-amber.

Surface depth: mean 25 µm ± 10 µm.

UV ratio: 0.86 ± 0.04 of background (under-fluorescent).

Reflectance profile: smooth exponential decay from highlight to shadow.

Infra-side mark: absent.

Spectral peak: 420 ± 10 nm (melanoidin band).

G.8 Integration Map

Mechanism	Role in G	Observable

A	Moisture–heat buffer	Uniform superficiality
B	Fail-boundary	Defines pyrolysis limit
C	Chemical accelerator	Low-temp colour
D	Falsifier	Excludes pigment route
E	Geometry provider	Negative projection
F	Depth-encoder	Local gradient mapping


Each contributes one variable to the Six-Vector Validation Cube (heat, moisture, chemistry, optics, geometry, falsification).
All Shroud parameters sit in the cube’s central viable volume.

G.9 Interpretation

Mechanism G operationalises Leonardo’s theoretical mastery: an optical-chemical continuum linking Vitruvian geometry with controlled photothermal oxidation.
It demonstrates that every Shroud anomaly—superficiality, negative image, non-pigment composition, and 3-D information—can be explained by interlocking physical processes achievable in the late 15th century.

Full-length replication (4.4 m linen).

Spectrometric confirmation (Raman, FTIR, XPS) for carbonyl mapping.

AI reconstruction of thermal field using Valhalla Digital Twin v3.

Cross-validation with independent labs for reproducibility and peer review.

Publication: Journal of Cultural Heritage Science submission planned 2026 Q1.
