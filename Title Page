Abstract Preview

This white paper presents a reproducible framework for testing whether the Shroud-like superficial image observed on linen could have been achieved using photothermal and optical methods available to a fifteenth-century workshop.  The research integrates experimental archaeology, heat–moisture modelling, and Renaissance optical geometry to reconstruct a credible process consistent with Leonardo da Vinci’s documented tools and materials.
